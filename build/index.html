        Seattle's South Lake Union has seen the effects of Amazon's headquarters:
        new buildings adjacent to massive construction zones. Wherever Amazon decided to
      set their HQ2 will likely see similar changes throughout their city.

        <p>Amazon has decided to make their selection process for their HQ2 public,
meaning that anyone and everyone has access to the <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf">criteria they're looking
for</a>
in their next hub. Recently, they narrowed their search down to 20 final candidate cities, and are expected to make their final
decision soon, with some experts predicting a decision within a month or so.
This interactive map will walk you through some of Amazon's main criteria, and
which cities do (and don't) fit the bill.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Here are all 20 cities. As you scroll down this article, various criteria from
Amazon will show up, and the map will pan and zoom to highlight the cities that
match. At any point you

          <h2>KEY</h2>
          <ul>
<li>Orange: city that <em>does</em> meet criteria</li>
<li>Red: city that <em>negatively</em> meets criteria</li>
<li>Black: city that <em>doesn't</em> meet criteria</li>

        <section class="map-item right" data-filter="j_growth" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Overall Job Growth</h2>
          <p>Amazon, in a document full of guidance for candidate cities, states that one
of their main requirements in a city is a &quot;stable and consistent business climate for
growth.&quot; Looking at overall job growth, we can see that a number of cities
stand out with more than 5% increase over the last 10 years.</p>

        <section class="map-item left" data-filter="t_growth" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Tech Sector Job Growth</h2>
          <p>Of course, it's not just any kind of job that Amazon is looking for. Taking
tech jobs into account, we can cross reference the cities with an overall job
growth of 5% in the last 10 years with cities that have a tech sector job growth
of more than 6% in the last 5 years. Adding tech jobs to the equation reduces us
down to only four cities.</p>

        <section class="map-item left" data-filter="incentives" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Incentives</h2>
          <p>Amazon also says that various incentives are
also going to be crucial in the selection process. These are all the cities that
have offered incentives of at least $1 billion.</p>

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="airports" data-highlight="negative">
          <h2>Commuting, Airports</h2>
          <p>One of the main decision factors listed by Amazon is the potential site's
access to airports: &quot;an international airport with daily direct
flights to Seattle, New York, San Francisco/Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. is
also an important consideration.&quot; We see that all but these three cities have
an airport that can meet this requirement.</p>

        </section>


    

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="traffic" data-highlight="negative">
          <h2>Commuting, Congestion</h2>
          <p>But what about the logistics of commuting <em>within</em> the city? Amazon says that
they'll need to be able to shuffle around 50,000+ employees every day. Based on
North American traffic congestion ratings, we see that 8 of the 20 candidate</p>

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="diverse" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Cultural Community Fit</h2>
          <p>In Amazon's criteria document, they mention the importance of a &quot;compatible cultural
and community environment for long term success&quot;. Emphasizing a &quot;diverse population&quot;, we highlight
the 5 out of 20 cities with the highest cultural diversity.</p>

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="lib" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Political Fit</h2>
          <p>Feeding off of Cultural Community Fit is the political climate of the candidate cities.
Amazon, being based in Seattle, is an extremely liberal company. Meaning that perhaps a city in a
liberal state would meet their desire for a &quot;local government structure and elected officials eager and willing to
work with the company&quot;. We highlight the cities that are in a significantly liberal state.</p>

        <section class="map-item left" data-filter="swing" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Swing States</h2>
          <p>Diving deeper into politics, we want to look at the influence that an additional 50,000 voters could
have on state politics. A recent article by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/amazon-headquarters-politics/553394/">The Atlantic</a> brought to light
the potential of Amazon's new base influencing the politics of an entire state,
and by extension, potentially flipping a red state blue. States like Ohio,
Pennsylvania and North Carolina are all considered swing states. Highlighted are all of the candidate cities that are in &quot;swing&quot; states.</p>

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="none" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Quality of Life</h2>
          <p>Amazon, in their criteria document, say that they want to &quot;invest in a community where our employees will enjoy living, recreational opportunities, educational
opportunities, and an overall high quality of life.&quot; Let's narrow it down to
two major components: cost of living and various amenities. These two
components are relatively proportional, with the latter generally leading to
the former. That being said, we look for cities that can strike a balance
between the two.</p>

        </section>


    

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="rent" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Cost of Living</h2>
          <p>Cities like Atlanta, Miami, Austin, Denver and Chicago all have
median rent prices below $1150 per month, making them relatively cheap for the
cost of living. However, even though Washington D.C. is on the more expensive
side, the much more affordable Baltimore is a short train ride away.</p>

        <section class="map-item " data-filter="happy" data-highlight="">
          <h2>Livability</h2>
          <p>For whichever city Amazon decides on, it's workers will not only be working in the city,
but most likely will be living within those city limits. We also want to take a look at
the livablity and happiness of all cities. We highlight the 6 out of 20 cities that have
both relatively affordable housing and are in the top 10 of happiest cities out of the 20 total.</p>

        <p>Though Amazon has yet to declare the date of their announcement, analysts report
that Amazon has visited all 20 candidate cities and is expected to make an
announcement soon. That being said, there are still many things that are left unanswered.</p>
<p>Sure, we know the criteria that Amazon <em>says</em> they'll take into consideration.
But is there going to be any more that gets factored into the decision? Austin is the headquarters
of Whole Foods, the grocery giant that was recently acquired by Amazon. LA is the only west-coast city,
and it seems like Amazon wants to reach out geographically. Speaking of geography, Toronto is
the only city out of the United States and, with 19 other cities all in the US, perhaps
Amazon is not looking at going international.</p>
<p>Also, though politics may fit in with Amazon's RFP on &quot;cultural and community fit&quot;, in the map we only looked at the cities that truly fit
in with Amazon's liberal backings. However, Dallas is the most &quot;red&quot; city out of the 20 candidates,
meaning that there may be more divisions brought into the greater Dallas area with an
extremely blue company coming into an already politically divided region. Lastly, perhaps (and hopefully)
Amazon is considering the ability for the candidate city to last long term. One of the direct results
of climate change has been that Miami is starting to progressively go underwater. In 10 years from now,
we may not know the status of infrastructure there. In all, there may be more factors at hand
beyond what's listed in Amazon's RFP.</p>
<p>Amazon has told us what they say they're looking for, and by looking at all the data we
see that cities like Austin, Atlanta and Denver seem to meet all the criteria. But, will Amazon
make their decision solely on this data? Or will there be other factors that only the top
execs know about? Only time will tell.</p>
